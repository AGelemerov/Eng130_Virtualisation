## What is virtualisation & benefits of it / ##

![Diagram](images/vagrant.png)

Virtualization is the process of running a virtual instance of a computer system in a layer separate from the actual hardware. It is often inefficient and costly for organizations to deploy multiple servers to keep pace with their storage and processing needs.

### Benefits / ###

- Reduced upfront hardware and continuing operating costs
- Minimized or eliminated downtime
- Increased IT productivity and responsiveness
- Greater business continuity and disaster recovery response
- Simplified data center management
- Faster provisioning of applications and resources

## What is Development Environment / ##

A development environment in software and web development is a workspace for developers to make changes without breaking anything in a live environment.

## What is Vagrant / ##

Tool for working with virtual environments, and in most circumstances, this means working with virtual machines. Vagrant provides a simple and easy to use command-line client for managing these environments, and an interpreter for the text-based definitions of what each environment looks like, called Vagrantfiles. Vagrant is open source, which means that anyone can download it, modify it, and share it freely.

## What is Virtual Box / ##

VirtualBox is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM (virtual machine) where the user can run another OS (operating system).

## Why should we use them all / ##

# Bash Scripting / #

`#!/bin/bash` - must be first line in file

# Syncing folder between localhost and VM / #

Enter Vagrantfile, type following command

- 1st param - host folder with root folder being the folder itself
- 2nd param - vm folder, absolute path required (if you are only moving a folder don't specify the name of it here )

 `config.vm.synced_folder "./folder_you_want_to_sync", "/home/vagrant/foldername"`

```markdown
NOTE:
Should automatically sync, but if not, reload vagrant
```

`ufw` - open/close ports

# How to setup task / #

```bash
# update system
sudo apt-get update -y

# upgrade system
sudo apt-get upgrade -y

# install nodejs
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

# install pm2
sudo npm install -g pm2

npm install

# install webserver called nginx
sudo apt-get install nginx -y   

# start nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx

```
